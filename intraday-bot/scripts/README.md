# scripts/ — operational glue (cross-cutting)

What doesn't fit cleanly into any single layer (resources / strategy /
execution / journal / review / dashboard). Helpers used by everything,
plus one-time installers.

## Contents

- `_common.py` — Config loader, ET clock, VAULT-first credential resolution (Alpaca, Telegram), state file paths, Telegram send, fill-event append, and the data-provider abstraction (`get_pm_bars` / `get_rth_minute_bars` / `get_latest_quote` / `get_latest_trade` — dispatches to IBKR or Alpaca by `cfg["data_provider"]`, with auto-fallback on IBKR failure). Underscore prefix marks it as an internal helper module.
- `_gating.py` — Per-strategy gating: ON/OFF flag (`state/enabled_<name>.flag`) and ARM flag (`state/armed_<name>.flag`). API: `is_enabled` / `set_enabled` / `is_armed` / `set_armed` plus bulk forms and a `bootstrap_from_config` helper that seeds the enable flags from `cfg.strategies.<name>.enabled` on first run. Read live by both the orchestrator and the dashboard.
- `setup_ibkr.py` — Interactive setup: writes IBKR creds + IBC bundle config. Asks for username / password / paper-or-live / IBC paths. Idempotent.
- `setup_gateway_autostart.py` — Optional Windows auto-start for IB Gateway (registry Run key).
- `setup_schedule.py` — Optional Windows Task Scheduler job that fires `execution/orchestrator.py` at 08:55 ET on weekdays.

## Why these are not in their own layer folder

`_common.py` and `_gating.py` are touched by every layer. Putting them
in any one layer would be wrong; putting them in a "lib/" or "core/"
would be another layer name to remember. Keeping them in `scripts/`
matches the historical convention.

The `setup_*.py` installers are one-shot tools, not part of the
runtime trading system. They could move to `bin/` or `tools/` but
they're rarely-touched and small, so `scripts/` is fine.

## Changelog

### 2026-05-21 — Slimmed down to operational glue only
- Removed `_journal.py`, `_events.py` (moved to `journal/`).
- Removed `_ibkr_data.py`, `_smoke_ibkr.py`, `_dryrun_ibkr.py`, `guns_float_lookup.py`, `guns_catalyst_classifier.py` (moved to `resources/`).
- Removed `guns_scanner.py` (moved to `strategy/GUNS/`).
- Removed `signals.py`, `strategies/` (moved to `strategy/`).
- Removed `trade_day.py` (moved to `execution/`).
- Removed `dashboard.py`, `setup_dashboard_launcher.py` (moved to `dashboard/`).
- Remaining: `_common.py`, `_gating.py`, `setup_ibkr.py`, `setup_gateway_autostart.py`, `setup_schedule.py`.

### 2026-05-21 — `_common.py` self-contained
- Dropped `../alpaca-trader-paper/.env` and `../MATP/.env` sibling-folder reads.
- New `_env_lookup` walks: `$INTRADAY_ENV_DIR` → `intraday-bot/.env` → `<Dropbox>/VAULT/Claude Credential/<vendor>.env`.
- `load_alpaca_env` and `telegram_env` use the new lookup. No more cross-folder dependencies.
- Added a sys.path bootstrap (adds intraday-bot/ root + every layer folder) so the lazy `from ibkr_data import ...` calls inside the data-provider dispatch functions resolve regardless of how the importer is invoked.

### 2026-05-21 — `_arming.py` → `_gating.py`
- Renamed to reflect the new ON/OFF gate added alongside the existing ARM gate.
- API now: `is_enabled` / `set_enabled` / `all_enabled_state` / `set_all_enabled` alongside the `_armed` siblings.
- Added `bootstrap_from_config(cfg, known)` — seeds enable flags from `cfg.strategies.<name>.enabled` on first run; after that the flag wins.
- Added `migrate_global_arm_flag(known)` — one-shot migration of the legacy single `state/armed.flag` to per-strategy `state/armed_<name>.flag`.

### 2026-05-21 — `_arming.py` added
- Per-strategy ARM flag (`state/armed_<name>.flag`).
- `is_armed(name)` is called from the bot's submit site so toggles take effect mid-session.
